# Hack Technology / Project Attempted No.2


## What you built? 

This project is an attempt to learn how the physics system work in Unity. Different elements are tried and set up, including:
1. First person RigidBody controller with ability to jump (can't jump mid-air) and react with other physics object in the environment
2. Built on the first, ability to pick up object, throw object inhand, and replace object inhand
2. Ragdoll physics on a humanoid, and enabling and disabling the ragdoll physics with scrips
3. Demonstration of how colliders, rigid body, triggers work
4. different ways of moving objects with transform location and velocity and add force

## What you learned

#### what worked
1. features written above all work well and are bug-free.
2. Learned about the basics of physic system with Unity.
3. The pickup feature looks similiar to Minecraft and I'm happy with how it turns out.

#### what did't work
1. the ragdoll controller rigs are a bit hard to work with, you need to set them up more precisely according to the model to not break the model's skin
2. didn't figure out how to incorporate ragdoll physics with an assigned animation, maybe that is not possible, needs further research
